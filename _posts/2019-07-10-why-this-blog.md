一New updates to the certification programs have been presented earlier this year's in Cisco Live in San Diego. These changes appear to be major and affecting each certification track. But how are they affecting the original study plan of becoming the CCIE?



## Small victories towards CCIE Collaboration


I really like the quote from Derek Thompson “To sell something familiar, make it surprising. To sell something surprising, make it familiar.” As I think it describes the fundamental concept for almost all companies in technology area, and not only. AI, Programmability and Automation all presented as new innovative concepts with familiar background. Algorithms that have been around since 1980s, with small changes in their application level.

I think that the reason why companies are forced to make such changes is to keep the interest in the community as with time passing by it starts to fade away. Certainly, that was the case for Collaboration, in my opinion. It was a time to this change and shift back the interest of the community who may or may not share the same though that doing the traditional CCNA to CCNP collaboration certification was boring, not up to date and it didn’t reflect with the practical side of what we are faced in new deployments or administration of the collaboration platforms, especially Cisco WebEx part. To reach the CCNP level you had to go through total of 7 exams which always made me say why should I ever get an CCNP when I can directly shoot for CCIE.

In the new strategy Cisco is aggregating the exams into a unified core exam with a specialization of choice for the CCNP certification or combining the core exam and the CCIE Lab to obtain the CCIE number. I think this model only drives more people like myself to aim for these certifications as validation of our earned knowledge as well as experience.

Like with every new release for the Certification track I feel a cloud with many questions arises in the first few months. Should I take the current version 2 of the exam which is set to expire or should I wait for the new version next February? What are the training materials? Has the blueprint changed? What does lab exam include?

From my point of view, yes there are changes, yes there are small adjustments but nothing drastic has changed. Remember the quote from Derek! Of course, it’s much easier if f you are currently working with Cisco Collaboration Systems and you continuously read and follow the trend or even participate in Cisco Partner training events. But trust me all it takes is a well thought plan and good execution to achieve your certification goal. Whether that is CCNP or CCIE Collaboration.

Personally, I’ve created this plan and strategy that I’m successfully tacking every day for the last 2 months. I’m giving myself 12-14 months to get my certification in CCIE. I can say that it is requesting true dedication and lots of sacrifices. But it also provides satisfaction as it’s really refreshing to go over the topics that I did read but didn’t really READ them. It does fuel my soul as well as my ambition, I’m a better man of it each day for myself, my company and our community.

So, if you ask me when should I start the preparation or which version of the exam should I take! I would say that there is no perfect time to start, there is no perfect plan to follow… but you can start now, plan an improve each day. Start by creating a solid plan based on the blueprint and your lifestyle. Don’t settle for an over ambitious plan but challenge yourself each day as you only need small victories each day. Remember your preparing for a challenge that is similar to the marathon, where pacing is everything. You will have your peaks and valleys, and challenge after challenge you will get there. So overall the change of the certification program in my opinion do not present a big obstacle, on the contrary it does spark new desire in me that I don’t believe it will go anyway until I accomplish my goal.

The reason why I’ve created this blog is to try and share my journey. Help inspire others who desire to pursuit the same goal as well as contribute to the community by sharing challenges that I face along my path.
