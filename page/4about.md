## About me

My name is Dijar Vrella, 25y/o born in Peja, Kosovo. Son of two wonderful parents, brother to a future doctor and partner to an outstanding and loving woman.

I've obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Telecommunications in University of Prishtina "Hasan Prishtina", Faculty of Electrical and Computer Engineering. Also I'm a student in the Master's Degree program in the same Faculty with a few exams left to obtain my Degree.

During my years in Faculty I've participated in multiple internships programs with roles varying from technical field engineer to IT administrator. Each one of these experienced helped me kickstart my journey in ways I couldn't ever imagine as young student. 

It all began with the job offer from the leading local Systems Integrator company "Infosoft Systems sh.p.k" while I was doing an internship in Ministry of Foreign Affairs as IT. The company at that time was performing UC platform upgrade to 11.x and I was involved in the project to create the IVR scripts for the Kosovo Embassies. When I received the offer I never heard of this company and I was hesitant at first but than after some research I decided to accept this offer. Today I'm happy I made that decision. Because I believe it was an experience of a lifetime having the chance to work in various local ICT projects in various sectors from Government, Financial Institutions and Retail with different solutions such as: Collaboration, Security, Wireless, Enterprise Networking and Data Center from various vendors such as: Cisco, Checkpoint, Aruba, HPE.

After a few years, another challenge arose. It seemed my restless effort to evolve have helped me to promote my name to another local outsourcing company "Kosbit" who was requesting my services to work for AT&T. Another challenge I'm really happy that I've accepted. Learning from the leading Global Service Provider in Cisco Hosted Collaboration Solution services has helped me understand Collaboration world from new dimensions. 

The good thing about this job was that it was US working hours (started 3PM Kosovo Time) and I've had the flexibility (also allowed by local laws) to participate in additional projects or jobs of my interests. That is when I accepted one of the most challenging project during my carrier, upgrading the Internet Edge Firewalls and Web Proxy for the entire Government of Kosovo. The project was won by the local Systems Integrator Novus Consulting and I was the lead engineer in the post-sales process as well implementation. Working 16 hours per day shifts for 7 months made me feel so alive even though my time with my family and friends reduced so much. 

I consider myself as really lucky to have the chances that I've had until now, and this blog is a way for me to start giving back to the community as well as share my strategy how I plan to tackle the CCIE Collaboration Certification and maybe help spark discussions on how to improve this plan.
